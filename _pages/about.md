Hello, I am Prahlad Yeri, Freelance Programmer and Writer.<br><br>

Educate and solve problems is my mantra and I'm here to provide you IT solutions &#128187;. I work on Web Development and Desktop Development projects.<br><br>

What sets me apart from most other freelancers is my adherence to a set of core principles that form the very basis of my freelancing process &#128215;. These principles are:
</p>
<p class='text-left'>
<ul class='text-left'>
<li>&#128073; <b>Work Ethics: </b>Work ethics goes into the very core of all my freelancing activity. Whether it's about managing source code or handling important documents or communicating &#128233; with the user, I understand that gaining long term success in the freelance world isn't possible without following basic work ethics.</li>
<li>&#128073; <b>Discipline: </b>Delivering the best results over time requires utmost discipline, be it in terms of processes &#128215;, skills &#128736; or client interaction &#128233;. I understand this well and discipline forms a core part of my value system.</li>
<li>&#128073; <b>Patience: </b>Software Engineering is an evolving field, debugging and fixing bugs isn't always easy, and the same could be said about understanding project requirements in the first place. This is where we need some patience to make the project a super success and it's a virtue I follow to the core.</li>
<li>&#128073; <b>Consistency: </b>Last but not the least, without consistently &#9200; following the core principles and applying them to our processes, any success achieved will only be fleeting at best. Just as my skills, my freelancing process itself evolves with time &#8987; and I strive to apply the new learnings to the best of my abilities.</li>
</ul>
