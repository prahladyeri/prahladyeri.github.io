- Basic issues like poverty, inequality, corruption, social injustices, political divisiveness, etc. still exist.
- Evolutionary checks exist:
	- Despite the prevailing chaos and utter mess, a semblance of order exists.
	- Evolution has somehow ensured throughout history that those who rise in authority are also worthy of making justice to it; though today's highly divisive identity based politics is disturbing that equilibrium too.
- AI will not only disturb this evolutionary balance but create an environment where corporations and departments can duck responsibility citing AI failure.
