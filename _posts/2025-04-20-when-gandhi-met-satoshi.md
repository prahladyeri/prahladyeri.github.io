title: "When Gandhi met Satoshi"
tags: blockchain technology philosophy fiction
---
*A fictional encounter between two radically different revolutionaries… or maybe not so different after all.*

**Scene:**  
A quiet room beyond time, filled with gentle candlelight. Mahatma Gandhi sits cross-legged on a simple mat, spinning a symbolic charkha (spinning wheel). A soft whirring sound is heard — it’s Satoshi Nakamoto, hooded and calm, typing quietly on an open-source laptop.

### **Gandhi (smiling gently):**  
I see you’re building something... abstract. Not cloth this time, but code?

### **Satoshi (nodding):**  
Yes. It’s called Bitcoin. A currency without rulers. A decentralized network where no single man holds the power.

### **Gandhi:**  
Ah! Decentralization. You speak of *Swaraj* — self-rule. But tell me, does this tool free people, or enslave them in new greed?

### **Satoshi:**  
That depends on the user. I built it so that no central bank, no emperor of finance, can erode the common man's savings.

### **Gandhi:**  
Hmm. That is noble. But in my land, I spun khadi — not to gain wealth, but to empower the weaver. Can your coin clothe the poor, feed the farmer?

### **Satoshi:**  
Not directly. But it can return power to local communities — if used wisely. It can fund clean water, create transparency in charity, help refugees carry value without paper.

### **Gandhi (thoughtfully):**  
Technology must serve the *last man*. The poorest. If your invention becomes the toy of the rich... it has failed its Dharma.

### **Satoshi (softly):**  
I agree. That's why I vanished. Power corrupts. I wished to spark something, not to rule over it.

### **Gandhi (smiling):**  
Then we share a path, my friend. The world will judge our ideas — not by their *cleverness*, but by the *compassion* they inspire.

**[A pause.]**  
The spinning wheel turns. The screen glows.

**Gandhi leans forward:**  
You must promise me, Satoshi — build for the village, not just the venture capitalist.

**Satoshi (grinning faintly):**  
Only if you promise to try a Raspberry Pi.

**[Fade out.]**  
The revolution continues — in code, in conscience, and in khadi.
