Bangalore has a very pleasant and human friendly climate but it's also very humid which often causes your crisp and powdered Bournvita to become a lump of stone like this one here:

There are two ways of tackling this problem and recover your favorite beverage:

1. The old school "brute force" way of breaking the lump with a large and pointed spoon or fork or something.
2. The "Potions Master Professor Snape" way of melting the lump into syrup and then using that syrup instead.

I chose the second one as Professor Snape happens to be one of my favorite characters! All you have to do is bring a cup of water to boil and pour it inside the Bournvita container. As it starts cooling down and melting the Bournvita, keep stirring occasionally so that the syrup is soft and smooth. After a few hours, once it melts completely, you can put it in refrigerator for use.

You can keep using it like regular Bournvita, add it to the milk for a delicious beverage or even drink a few spoonfuls for a change. It will taste as good (perhaps even better!) as the powdered version of Bournvita.
