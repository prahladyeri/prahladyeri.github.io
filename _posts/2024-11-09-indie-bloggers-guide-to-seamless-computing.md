Indie bloggers are on the constant lookout for tools that simplify their work while keeping costs low and user experience seamless. One of the most overlooked aspects of running a blog is finding the right comment hosting system. Enter **giscus**, a modern solution that stands out among its peers for being lightweight, privacy-friendly, and free to use. Here's why it's the best comment hosting system for the indie blogger living in today's digital age.

## Benefits of static hosting

### 1. No hassles of website maintenance

Indie bloggers love static websites for good reason. Unlike traditional dynamic websites, static sites come with zero server-side headaches. Once you've deployed your content, you don’t need to worry about database management, server updates, or unexpected downtime caused by backend failures. Platforms like **Hugo**, **Jekyll**, and **Gatsby** make it easier than ever to generate and maintain static sites. Add a robust version control system like **GitHub**, and your content stays safe with every update neatly tracked.

### 2. No costly backend bills to pay

Keeping a dynamic website up and running can be an expensive affair. Backend servers and database management come with their own set of recurring costs, from hosting fees to maintenance bills. These expenses can quickly add up, especially for indie bloggers who are not monetizing their content or are just starting out. Static site generators, paired with free hosting options, offer a refreshing alternative that doesn’t put a dent in your wallet.

### 3. Free platforms for the pleb

Gone are the days when hosting a blog meant shelling out money for a server. Platforms like **GitHub Pages**, **Netlify**, and **Vercel** offer free static site hosting that’s perfect for indie bloggers. These platforms come with seamless deployment pipelines, allowing you to push updates to your blog in a matter of seconds. And since static hosting doesn’t require server-side processing, the pages load lightning fast, ensuring a smooth user experience for readers.

## The horrors of privacy-invasive third-party systems like Disqus

In the past, the go-to solution for adding comments to a blog was **Disqus**. While popular, Disqus became synonymous with intrusive ads, data tracking, and privacy concerns. Here are some of the pain points many bloggers and users have faced:

- **Tracking and privacy issues**: Disqus is notorious for collecting user data and tracking user behavior across the web. For bloggers who value their readers' privacy, this is a significant red flag.
- **Ads and monetization**: Disqus's free version often injects ads into your blog’s comment section, cluttering the user experience and taking away from the essence of the content.
- **Slow load times**: Disqus can slow down the loading speed of your site due to its heavy scripts and external calls, which negatively impacts SEO and user satisfaction.

The modern blogger who champions simplicity and transparency needs an alternative that respects user privacy while being lightweight and functional.

## The horrors of coding and maintaining your own commenting system

Some bloggers may consider building their own commenting system to avoid the pitfalls of third-party options. While this sounds like an appealing DIY project, it comes with its own set of nightmares:

- **Complexity**: Developing a custom commenting system requires backend expertise, database integration, and server management. This can be overwhelming, especially for bloggers focused more on writing than on coding.
- **Security risks**: Handling user-generated content means dealing with potential security threats like SQL injection and spam bots. Keeping the system secure requires ongoing updates and vigilance.
- **Maintenance**: A custom-built system needs consistent maintenance. Any change in server configuration or software updates can disrupt the system and create additional work for the blogger.

For the indie blogger who doesn’t want to spend their time coding or worrying about security flaws, a more straightforward option is essential.

## Enter the middle ground: why giscus is the best of both worlds

[**giscus**](https://giscus.app/) offers a perfect balance between ease of use, privacy, and functionality. Here’s why it’s the ideal comment hosting system for the indie blogger:

### 1. Fully integrated with GitHub

- **Transparent data management**: All comment data is stored on GitHub, a platform that millions of developers trust.
- **Easy moderation**: You can manage, edit, or delete comments directly from GitHub, leveraging the familiar interface and robust features.
- **Open-source spirit**: giscus itself is open-source, which aligns with the values of transparency and collaboration many indie bloggers uphold.

### 2. Lightweight and fast

Unlike heavyweight comment systems, giscus is built with performance in mind. It doesn’t add bloat to your site, ensuring that your pages load quickly and smoothly. This is especially important for maintaining good SEO and providing a seamless experience for mobile readers.

### 3. Privacy-focused

**giscus** does not track users or display ads, making it an excellent choice for bloggers who want to maintain a privacy-friendly site. Since comments are facilitated through GitHub accounts, users already familiar with GitHub’s policies can engage confidently.

### 4. Simple installation

Setting up giscus is a breeze. Here’s how to get started:

1. **Create a GitHub repository** or use an existing one to store the discussions.
2. **Visit the giscus website** and generate the code snippet by selecting your repository and preferred discussion category.
3. **Copy the provided code** and paste it into your site’s codebase where you want the comment section to appear.
4. **Deploy your site**, and voilà! You have a fully functional, GitHub-based commenting system.

### 5. User-friendly for commenters

Engagement through giscus requires users to log in with their GitHub account, which appeals to a tech-savvy audience that values simplicity and privacy. For users already on GitHub, commenting feels seamless, and they can subscribe to discussions without having to create yet another account.

### 6. Community-driven enhancements

Because giscus is an open-source project, it evolves based on user feedback. Developers can contribute improvements, making it a community-driven tool that adapts over time.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right comment system is critical for any blogger, especially those who want a balance between ease of use, privacy, and functionality. While legacy systems like Disqus have paved the way for commenting but introduced privacy issues, and coding your own system is often impractical, **giscus** shines as the modern, lightweight solution that respects privacy and integrates seamlessly with static sites. It’s time for indie bloggers to make the shift and experiment with giscus—the best comment hosting system for present times.
