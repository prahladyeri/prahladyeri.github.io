**Experienced Software Developer with a Focus on Problem-Solving and Quality**

Hello, I am Prahlad Yeri. Educate and solve problems is my mantra. With over 10 years of experience in IT across industries such as Telecom, Mechanical, and Electrical, I specialize in both **Desktop Development** (.NET/WinForms) and **Web Development** (PHP, Flask). My approach to every project starts by deeply understanding the problem at hand and architecting the most efficient solution to meet user requirements.

Beyond just writing code, I emphasize **best practices**â€”from **Agile methodologies** to **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and design patterns. My goal is to deliver robust, high-performing solutions that stand the test of time.

What truly sets me apart is my commitment to core principles:
- **Work Ethics**: Ensuring transparency and professionalism in communication and deliverables.
- **Discipline**: Adhering to timelines, processes, and quality standards consistently.
- **Patience**: Solving complex problems with attention to detail.
- **Consistency**: Continuously learning and refining my process to provide you with the best possible results.

If you're looking for a reliable, solutions-driven developer to bring your project to life, I'm confident that I'm the right fit for your needs. Let's work together to create software that delivers real value.
